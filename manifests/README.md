  # Manifest Files
  
  These are used by the tool to parse up to date versions and information on which things to validate and install.
  
  They are grouped into the following channels:
  
  
  ### Default

  ### Preview

  - maui-preview.manifest.json
  - https://aka.ms/dotnet-maui-check-manifest-preview
  
  ### Main
